			🧾 Step 4: Check IP Reputation (the hidden issue)
Sometimes dedicated IPs are new or used by other users previously — banks detect this.

Do this:

Copy your current IP (from whatismyipaddress.com)
Visit https://scamalytics.com/ip
Check “Fraud Score”
✅ Score under 50 → Safe for banking
❌ Over 50 → SBT Bank may auto-block it → Contact NordVPN support and request a replacement U.S. Dedicated IP (mention “banking access blocked”)
🧱 Step 5: Test a Stable DNS Tunnel
To test your reliability: Open Command Prompt → run:

bash

ipconfig /flushdns
ping sbtpg.com
tracert sbtpg.com
All hops should show us.nordvpn.com domains and U.S. routes only.
❌ If there’s a .my route (Malaysia) → your adapter priority order is wrong.
To fix:

bash

netsh interface ipv4 show interfaces
netsh interface ipv4 set interface <index_of_NordVPN> metric=1
